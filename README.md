# Thesis 

This repo contains all of the code used to complete my 2022 University of Oregon Computer Science 
Undergraduate Honors Thesis. Not all documents used are able to be uploaded due to thesis is 
part of a larger project in the IDEAS Group at the UO High Performance Computing Lab (HPCL) and 
I do not have ownership of all resources used. 

Thesis document and _avl.ipynb_ contains the main documentation and code used to complete this 
project. Other notebooks used to test different algorithms and methods are in the sub folder.

access data in the IDEAS database.
